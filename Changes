Revision history for dip

    - The --script and --exec options can be given several times and be
      interleaved
    - The --verbose option can be given several times
    - Options can be passed to dip scripts using --define key=value
    - The count-uri-new-with-ustack.dip example dip script demonstrates how to
      use options passed to dip scripts
    - The dip program now assembles the whole Instrumentation code and writes
      it to a temporary file; when perl is called with "-Mdip", that file's
      name is passed. This is much cleaner and safer than passing the whole
      instrumentation code on the command-line.
    - Better documentation
